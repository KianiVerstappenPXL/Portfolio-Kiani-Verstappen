                During a phase where I dove into creating videos and streams for YouTube, I crafted this small project—a thumbnail for one of my livestreams. I designed it using Photopea, a free online tool that’s remarkably similar to Photoshop. Without access to Photoshop at the time, Photopea became my creative playground to bring my ideas to life.

                This project was a school assignment where we worked extensively in Photoshop. It involved mastering a variety of tools like smart objects, masks, and much more. One of the challenges was seamlessly fitting the basketball player into the phones and carefully changing the color of the player’s shirt on the right. It was a great exercise in precision and creative problem-solving.

                This dashboard is a visual design I created together with my group during my studies. We chose a manga/comic style for the website, which made the project really fun and unique. I’m proud to showcase this here because I absolutely love how it turned out for us!
