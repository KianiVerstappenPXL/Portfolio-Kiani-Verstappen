      <h2>Discription of my case!</h2>
      <p>
        For this case, our team was assigned the task of redesigning the website for Rewild.be, a project centered around reconnecting people with nature. Rather than making minor updates or changes to the existing site, we decided to rebuild the platform from the ground up. The goal was to give the website a fresh, modern look while staying true to the core mission and identity of Rewild â€” promoting awareness and engagement with nature in a meaningful and inspiring way.

        One of the main challenges in this project was maintaining the essence of Rewild while introducing a completely new structure and design language. To achieve this, we conducted extensive research. This included analyzing the current site, gathering feedback from target users, exploring other nature-based initiatives for inspiration, and identifying modern UX/UI trends that could enhance the user experience.

        Our redesign process was methodical and collaborative. We began with wireframes and prototypes, iterating through multiple versions based on usability tests and team discussions. We aimed to create a clear information flow, visual consistency, and an immersive experience that reflects the spirit of Rewild. Additionally, we paid attention to accessibility and responsiveness so that the site would work smoothly across different devices.

        The final result was a fully redesigned website that preserves the Rewild brand while making it more engaging, intuitive, and aesthetically appealing. The new website includes improved navigation, refined typography and layout, stronger imagery, and interactive elements that invite users to explore and connect.

        This project not only improved my skills in web design and development, but also taught me how to balance creative freedom with brand consistency. It was a valuable experience in team collaboration, problem-solving, and building a product that meets real-world needs.

      <h2>My part in this!</h2>
      <p>
        During the Rewild.be website redesign project, I played a key role in both the research and development phases. From the very beginning, I was actively involved in shaping the foundation of the new website, particularly through wireframing, user experience planning, and hands-on implementation.

        One of my primary responsibilities was designing the wireframes. I created detailed layouts that helped define the structure and flow of the new site. These wireframes served as a blueprint for the design and development teams, allowing us to visualize and test user navigation early on. By focusing on clarity and usability, I ensured that the user journey across different pages was smooth and intuitive. This process required a deep understanding of the Rewild concept and how users would interact with the platform.

        In addition to my design and development tasks, I was also responsible for managing our Jira board. This meant setting up and maintaining all of our user stories, tasks, and progress tracking throughout the project. I ensured that the workflow remained organized, everyone had a clear overview of their responsibilities, and deadlines were met efficiently. This organizational role allowed us to stay on track and collaborate effectively as a team.

        Another major contribution I made was conducting thorough research. I studied current web design trends, accessibility standards, and similar non-profit or nature-focused websites to gather insights. This research helped shape our approach and ensured that the new site would meet modern expectations while remaining true to Rewildâ€™s values. I also looked into technical best practices and optimization strategies to support better site performance and user retention.

        In the later stages of the project, I worked extensively on building the actual website. I collaborated closely with the development team to implement the designs, translate the wireframes into responsive layouts, and integrate interactive elements. I ensured that the final product was not only visually appealing but also functional and aligned with our original vision.

        Throughout the project, I maintained strong communication with my teammates, participated in feedback sessions, and made sure that every detail matched the standards we had set. This experience strengthened my skills in design thinking, problem-solving, project coordination, and technical execution.

        Looking back, I am proud of my contribution to the Rewild.be project. It was an excellent opportunity to apply and further develop my skills in both UX design and web development in a real-world context.

        This project was a very enjoyable and valuable experience. I learned a lot and significantly improved my general skills, especially in tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator. I also became much better at working collaboratively within a larger team, which helped me grow both professionally and personally. Iâ€™m proud of what we accomplished and grateful for everything I was able to learn and create during this project.
