    <p>
      During my WPL2 experience, I had the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally. Through working on the Rewild project, I learned how to better collaborate in a team, apply design tools such as Figma and Illustrator, and manage workflows using Jira.
      I also gained deeper insight into my strengths and working style thanks to the Thalento Q-SCAN. I discovered that I thrive in a supportive team environment, value communication and structure, and enjoy working toward concrete goals.

      This project helped me develop essential soft skills like giving and receiving feedback, staying flexible under pressure, and managing time across different tasks. I also realized how passionate I am about creating digital solutions with real impactâ€”especially when they relate to sustainability or well-being.
